# Auto update Vietnam stock price daily

## Problem
After create my [vndata](https://github.com/vuthanhdatt/vnstock-data-python) package. I'm thinking of making data easy to access for everyone not only Python user. So I create this repo to automatically update trading data to google sheet so that user can easily access trading data for techincal analysis with another tool.

## Product
User can access daily price in 3 sperate google sheet. Each sheet contain data on one exchange. Data will be updated every day after 3pm with Github Action. Due to lots of companies on UPCOM exchange, I divide UPCOM into 2 sheet.
1. [HOSE](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Br0SphvPJH5PZ0JSFtZk24dHUsR17uxIM4s38GBCAA4/edit?usp=sharing)
2. [HNX](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1wM8UK3UbDGQJk_TkF292vYSe2OC4chxLTHVmta9D16A/edit?usp=sharing)

User can also access to each individual company in 3 folder [hose](https://github.com/vuthanhdatt/vn-stock-price/tree/main/hose), [hnx](https://github.com/vuthanhdatt/vn-stock-price/tree/main/hnx), [upcom](https://github.com/vuthanhdatt/vn-stock-price/tree/main/upcom) of this repository.
